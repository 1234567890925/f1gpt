# Concepts used in this project:

We start with importing external libraries:

1. DataAPIClient - interacts with astra db to further connect to the database, create collection and inserting data.
2. OpenAI - Accesses opensi's api embeddings which are essential for semantic search
3. PuppeteerWebBaseLoader - Allows the code to scrape dynamic web pages and extract relevant content
4. dotenv - Simplifies configuration management by loading sensitive data (e.g., API keys) from environment variables.
5. RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter - Breaks down large text into manageable chunks, ensuring compatibility with embedding models and database constraints.
6. gpt-3-encoder - Helps manage token limits when working with OpenAI's models.

List of concepts used in the project so far:

- Asynchronous Programming:
  Use of async/await for handling asynchronous operations.

- Error Handling:
  Try/catch blocks for managing errors.

- API Requests:
  Making API requests to OpenAI for embeddings.

- Rate Limiting and Retry Logic:
  Handling API quota limits and retrying failed requests.

- Tokenization:
  Calculating token counts using gpt-3-encoder.

- Database Operations:
  Interacting with Astra DB (DataStax) for creating collections and inserting data.

- Web Scraping:
  Using Puppeteer to scrape web pages.

- Text Splitting:
  Splitting large text into smaller chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

- Vector Embeddings:
  Generating vector embeddings using OpenAI's API.

- Logging and Debugging:
  Logging messages to the console for debugging.

- Event Loop and Timers:
  Using setInterval to reset a request counter periodically.

**Code flow**

1. Importing Libraries
2. Initialize OpenAI Client
   What’s Happening: The OpenAI client is initialized using the API key from environment variables.
3. Test OpenAI API
   What’s Happening: A test request is made to the OpenAI API to generate embeddings for a sample input. This ensures the API is working.
4. Delay Function
   What’s Happening: A utility function is created to introduce delays (e.g., for retrying API requests).
5. Handle API Requests with Retry Logic
   What’s Happening: This function generates embeddings for a text chunk. If the API quota is exceeded, it retries after a delay of 1 min. If we still get an error, it throws the error.
6. Calculate Token Count
   What’s Happening:
   The encode function from gpt-3-encoder tokenizes the input text.
   The length of the resulting token array is returned as the token count.
   - A **token** is the basic unit of text that a language model processes.
   - In OpenAI's GPT, tokens can be thought of as chunks of text that the model understands.
7. Request Counter and Reset
   What’s Happening: A counter tracks the number of API requests made per second and resets every second.
8. Load Environment Variables
   What’s Happening: Environment variables are loaded for database and API configuration.
9. Initialize Astra DB Client
   What’s Happening: The Astra DB client is initialized using the application token and endpoint.
10. Initialize Text Splitter
    What’s Happening: A text splitter is initialized to break large text into smaller chunks.
11. Create Collection in Astra DB
    What’s Happening: This function checks if a collection exists in Astra DB. If not, it creates one with a specified vector configuration.
12. Load Sample Data
    What’s Happening: This function scrapes content from a list of URLs, splits it into chunks, generates embeddings, and inserts the data into Astra DB.
13. Scrape Web Pages:
    What’s Happening: This function scrapes content from a given URL using Puppeteer and cleans the HTML.
14. Execute the Pipeline:
    What’s Happening: The script creates a collection in Astra DB (if it doesn’t exist) and then loads sample data into it.

**Detail topics:**

- chunkSize: 512: maximum number of characters (or tokens, depending on the splitter) allowed in each chunk.
  To ensure that the text is broken into pieces that fit within these limits.

- chunkOverlap: 100: number of characters (or tokens) that will overlap between consecutive chunks.
